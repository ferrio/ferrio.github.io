           We have reserved blocks of rooms from 6/4/20-6/8/20  in 2 sections of the Grand Palladium Riviera Maya, The Colonial and the TRS. The Colonial is the family section and the TRS is the adults only section.
           Guests choosing to stay in either of the sections can access all amenities, restaurants, beaches, pools, etc. of the other sections in the resort (except for children in the TRS sections).

        <div class="col-md-12 py-3">
          The resort is all-inclusive, which means that all your food, drinks (including top shelf liquor when requested), 24 hour room service, mini bar with liquor, mixers, juice, water etc.
          in all rooms and is refilled every day, non-motorized activities at the beach and pools, kids/teens clubs and activities, and much more, are all included in the daily rate.
          It's pretty amazing to know what you'll be paying for your entire trip and not have to worry about how much you drank/ate and get that surprise bill when you check out!

            <h3><span class="pink" style="margin-left:-3px;">Booking Options</span></h3>

            There are 2 options for booking rooms.<br /> <br />

            <h4><span class="pink" style="margin-left:-3px;">Option 1</span></h4>

            For those wanting to book a junior suite for the dates of 6/4/20-6/8/20 at either of the hotel sections you will use a "mini-website" the booking company has set up for us.
            You can only use this site if you want the jr suite on those dates. All other room types as well as those wanting to stay longer/earlier than 6/4/20-6/8/20 will
            need to use option 2 and call the booking company. <br /><br />

            Here is the website to book a jr suite from 6/4/20-6/8/20:<br />
            <a href="https://www.classicvacations.com/gr/ericaandalexwedding/gateway">https://www.classicvacations.com/gr/ericaandalexwedding/gateway</a><br />
