            For those wanting to book a junior suite for the dates of 6/4/20-6/8/20 at either of the hotel sections you will use a "mini-website" the booking company has set up for us.
            You can only use this site if you want the jr suite on those dates. All other room types as well as those wanting to stay longer/earlier than 6/4/20-6/8/20 will
            need to use option 2 and call the booking company. <br /><br />

            Here is the website to book a jr suite from 6/4/20-6/8/20:<br />
